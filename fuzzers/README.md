The main build scripts are in:
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/mapserver
and use fuzzer source code in this directory.

The list of issues is in:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=mapserver

- Build fuzzer reproducer programs
  ```
    $ cmake -DBUILD_FUZZER_REPRODUCER=ON /path/to/source/root
  ```

  Run one against a reproducer file (typically generated by OSS Fuzz):
  ```
    $ fuzzers/shapefuzzer_reproducer path_to_reproducer_file
  ```
  
- Run locally OSS Fuzz:
  ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
    $ cd oss-fuzz
    $ export PROJECT_NAME=mapserver
    $ python infra/helper.py build_image $PROJECT_NAME
  ```

  Build fuzzers with the address sanitizer (could use undefined, etc...)
  ```
    $ python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --sanitizer address $PROJECT_NAME
  ```

  Test a particular fuzzer (replace shapefuzzer by other fuzzers)
  ```
    $ python infra/helper.py run_fuzzer $PROJECT_NAME shapefuzzer
  ```
